# Github Guide
## How to make edits to the Estate Watch website and submit them for review

The Estate Watch website uses a static site generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) together with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to store and publish data. To edit the site you will first need to sign up for a (free) github account at <https://github.com/signup>.

Once you are signed up and logged in to Github you will be able to click on any of the links on the Estate Watch website such as the one below:

		      <a href="https://github.com/estatewatch/estatewatch/blob/main/{{ page.inputPath }}">Edit this page on GitHub</a>

This will take you to the relevant text file on Github where you can edit the page. 
Note that the first time you click on any such link, you will be asked if you want to 'fork' the repository.
