Circa 50 homes on the Neville Close estate have been earmarked for demolition in Ealing's [2024 Local Plan](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/19587/appendix_e_-_results.pdf).

The Local Plan's site allocation states that _"the site is being actively marketed for development or enquiries have been received from a developer."_

It is not known if residents have been made aware of the proposals.
