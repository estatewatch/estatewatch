Circa 150 homes on RBKC's Wornington Green estate remain earmarked for demolition by Catalyst Housing Association on phase 3 of its scheme.

The estate's original 538 council homes are being replaced by 1,000 new homes, the precise tenure of which is still unclear.

Catalyst's [website](https://www.chg.org.uk/development-regeneration/regeneration/wornington-green-kensington/) describes the replacement social housing as 'affordable rent':

The Mayor <a href="/approved/funding">approved funding</a> for the scheme in 2017 and <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exempted</a> it from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

Natasha Langridge, a temporary resident on the estate, has directed a [project recording the oral histories of residents](https://worningtonword.renegadetheatre.co.uk/). Here's one of the audio extracts from Keith Stirling - chairman of the Wornington Green Residents Association:

In September 2022, residents on the final remaining phase of the estate [complained](https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/life-half-demolished-west-london-25083396) that they had been living on a building site for more than 10 years.

Planning permission for the remaining phase 3 of the scheme is due to be decided in Autumn 2024. Local community activists have set up a website campaigning for more social housing and the retention of trees: <https://www.worningtontrees.com/>
