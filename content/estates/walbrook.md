126 council homes are under threat of demolition at Walbrook House in Enfield.

An April 2023 [council report](https://governance.enfield.gov.uk/documents/s97590/HRD2324_007%20Walbrook%20House%20Part%201%20-%2018%20April%2023.pdf) claims that the block requires refurbishment to meet decent homes standard.

The cost of this refurbishment was originally estimated as £14m in 2020 but the report explains that because of external factors this estimate has now risen to £30m.

The report refers to an options appraisal assessment undertaken by Savills, which summarises that _"refurbishment of the tower to re-let at social rent tenure ... is unviable particularly when compared to the other options."_.

Enfield council is underway with decanting tenants from the block and as at 2023, only 20 homes remained occupied.
