Circa 100 homes remain earmarked for demolition in phases 3 and 4 of Lewisham's redevelopment of the Excalibur estate in Catford.

Phases 1 and 2 of the scheme are nearing completion but it would appear that phases 3 and 4 have stalled.

The estate's initial 189 homes are being redeveloped by housing association L&Q in conjunction with Lewisham Council.

Permission was granted in 2013 for 362 new homes of which 166 social/affordable rent.
