80 homes have been earmarked for demolition on Greenwich's Brookhill Close estate.

A ballot was approved in May 2019 and plans are now being drawn up in a preliminary design stage before going out to consultation. Hyde Housing Association, which owns the estate, [says that the plans will](https://www.hyde-housing.co.uk/news/estate-regeneration/putting-resident-engagement-at-the-heart-of-regeneration/) provide 272 new flats and houses with _"76 social rented homes for existing residents and London Affordable Rent homes for new tenants"_. There will also be 64 homes for shared ownership and a further 132 for private sale.

A planning application for 254 new homes was approved in February 2023.

Leaseholders and freeholders on the estate are being offered a direct home swap for a new home on the redeveloped estate at no cost.
