Circa 500 homes on the Golf Links estate in Ealing are under threat of demolition.

The regeneration of the Golf Links estate in Ealing was originally supposed to involve the redevelopment of just four low-rise blocks in 3 phases - (Phase 1 - Dormers Rise, Phase 2 - Peterhead Court, phase 3 - Alnmouth & Portrush blocks). 

In October 2018, Ealing Council [resolved](https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=T29KJkkv6%2B%2FEOf%2F4pv0XwtQAUSiI7enW%2FlmOaGncZVyUQOQgHSXqXw%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D) to extend the regeneration involving the further demolition of circa 100 homes in a fourth phase.

Whilst phase 3 has received in-principle agreement for grant funding from the Mayor, it is exempt from the Mayor's requirement to ballot residents because there are less than 150 homes proposed for demolition.
