350 homes are under threat of demolition at Mendip and Penine House on the Edmonton Green estate.

According to landlord MTVH the blocks which stand above Edmonton Green Shopping Centre and rise to 25 storeys tall – “require significant structural strengthening work to meet current building safety regulations”.

In 2023, MTVH commissioned a structural survey in response to new legislation on tall buildings, which reported the issues. 

MTVH has a website FAQ for residents in which it declares that _"The specialist engineers who completed these surveys, Wilde Carter Clack, advised that the buildings are currently safe to live in. Please be assured that there is no immediate danger to you or your home."_
