43 homes are under threat on the Concorde Close estate in Hounslow. The estate is owned and managed by housing association [Home Group](http://homegroup.org.uk).

Home Group applied to demolish and redevelop the estate in 2018. These plans were turned down by Hounslow's planning committee in January 2019 after residents [complained](https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s145242/CCRA_Forum_Presentation_30Aug2018.pdf) that they hadn't been consulted and that their estate was being run down deliberately to make the case for redevelopment.

Home Group now [claims](https://www.homegroup.org.uk/about-us/working-with-us/development-partners/regeneration/concorde-close/) that it is undertaking a full review of the scheme and revising its options as follows:

Home Group commissioned an [options appraisal study](/images/bnpp.pdf) for the estate by BNP Paribas, which claims that the homes on the estate have a negative NPV (Net Present Value) - i.e. the estimated cost of maintenance over the next 30 years exceeds the projected rental income.

But the figure includes Â£2m of costs associated with a separate cost appraisal [report](/images/arcus.pdf) commissioned by Arcus and effectively double counts these costs in its own estimate (see appendix 7 of the BNP Paribas report).
