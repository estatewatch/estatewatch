795 homes on Enfield's Joyce Avenue and Snells Park estates in Edmonton have been [earmarked for demolition](https://new.enfield.gov.uk/services/housing/housing-development-and-renewal/joyce-avenue-and-snells-park-leaflet-housing.pdf) by Enfield Council.

The Council is [reported](https://enfielddispatch.co.uk/major-estate-plans-to-go-to-vote/) to be intending to hold a ballot in October 2021. Its dedicated website for the scheme provides further details [here](http://www.joyceandsnells.co.uk/).

In 2015, Enfield's Cabinet [agreed](https://governance.enfield.gov.uk/documents/g9278/Public%20reports%20pack%2018th-Nov-2015%2020.15%20Cabinet.pdf?T=10) to consider charging affordable rent for new council homes built as part of its estate renewals, albeit not necessarily at the full 80% of market rent.

The redevelopment plans date back to October 2015, when the Council's Cabinet agreed an Estate Renewal Programme (2016-2025) setting out its plans for redeveloping a number of its council estates (item 24):
[https://governance.enfield.gov.uk/documents/s54537/final1610Estate%20Renewal%20Cabinet%20Report%20-%20Oct%202015%20Final%20v12%2015.10.15%202.pdf](https://governance.enfield.gov.uk/documents/s54537/final1610Estate%20Renewal%20Cabinet%20Report%20-%20Oct%202015%20Final%20v12%2015.10.15%202.pdf)

Appendix 2 to that report, which lists the estates earmarked for renewal, has been witheld by the Council on grounds of commercial sensitivity.

In September 2021, the Council [applied for a scoping opinion](https://planningandbuildingcontrol.enfield.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage) for up to 1,992 new homes on the estate footprint. The [scoping report](https://planningandbuildingcontrol.enfield.gov.uk/online-applications/files/757E9B87467516101DC9D4D98221C1EA/pdf/21_03691_SCOP-Scoping_Opinion-2532448.pdf) confirmed that of the 795 existing homes, 430 were social rent plus 155 resident leaseholders and 210 non-resident leaseholders.

A ballot of estate residents was held in November 2021. 78% of eligible residents voted in favour of redevelopment on an 85% turnout.

A planning application was approved in September 2022 for 1900 new homes.
