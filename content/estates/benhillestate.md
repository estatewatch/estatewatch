Sutton Council's website has a [dedicated website](https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200502/housing_advice_and_options/1781/benhill_estate_regeneration/3) for the Benhill estate regeneration, which it claims is in consultation stage and that no decision on the estate's future has yet been taken. It provides details of the rehousing commitment to tenants and leaseholders as well as information on forthcoming consultation events.
