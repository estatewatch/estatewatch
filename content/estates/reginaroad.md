Circa 200 homes have been earmarked for demolition on Croydon's Regina Road estate.

The estate was earmarked for demolition in a [November 2022 Cabinet report](https://democracy.croydon.gov.uk/documents/s41429/12a%20Report%20-%20Regina%20Road.pdf) in which Croydon Council says it wants to demolish the three tower blocks on Regina Road that were at the centre of a scandal last year because of the appalling living conditions caused by leaks and damp.

The report also includes the low-rise maisonette blocks and two-storey blocks on the estate within the boundary of the potential redevelopment plans.
