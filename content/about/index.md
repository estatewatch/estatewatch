# About Us

<div class="message-box">
We are a network of tenants and residents’ groups and individuals whose estates are at risk of demolition or are in the process of demolition. Supported by <a href="https://justspace.org.uk"> Just Space</a>, we provide help and guidance to residents living on estates earmarked for demolition.
We support residents engaging in discussion to make their own decisions about what might work best on their estates. We have created a number of factsheets, handouts and guides and also hold meetings for residents where we exchange experiences and advice.

The project was initially kickstarted in 2020 by <a href="https://justspace.org.uk/"><u> Just Space</u></a> and <a href="https://londontenants.org/">The London Tenants Federation</a> working together with the University of Leicester and King’s College London on a research project that has provided detailed evidence since 1997 of the displacement of London council tenants and leaseholders through regeneration schemes.

As the research project drew to a close, this website was developed as a resource for communities on estates facing regeneration, to know their rights and to ensure that tenants and residents’ choices will be respected. We want to monitor each scheme as it progresses and make space for residents to add updated information about their estate in real time. This can be a precious tool to hold Councils across London and the Mayor to account and make sure that future regeneration schemes benefit existing local communities.

The Estate Watch website is now maintained as an open-source project and is being kept up to date by voluntary contributors via its Github interface. If you would like to get involved then read our <a href="/guide/"> Guide</a> on how to submit edits for review via Github.
