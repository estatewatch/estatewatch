<summary>What is wrong with redeveloping London's housing estates?</summary>

* Despite best intentions, replacement housing is largely privately owned and invariably ends up in a loss of council and social rented housing.
* Long-standing communities suffer uncertainty, disruption and are dispersed.
* Structurally sound buildings are needlessly demolished and replaced, creating a significant carbon impact.

<summary>But the private housing cross subsidises the replacement social housing doesn't it?</summary>

Despite best intentions, the cost of replacement social housing and demolition/rehousing is subsidised mainly via local authorities, grant funding or by increasing the rents on replacement affordable housing. See [here] and [here] for examples.

<summary>But maintenance costs on these old estates are a burden on councils and RSLs aren't they? </summary>

Despite their age and lack of investment, evidence shows that most estates actually provide a surplus when rental income is compared to maintenance costs. See [here] and [here] for examples.

<summary>But residents have voted for the demolition of their own estates, why shouldn't their wishes be respected?</summary>

There are a number of problems with the current ballot process.

1. Refurbishment is never an option on the ballot paper. Residents are faced with the option of demolition or managed decline.

<summary>London needs more homes, why shouldn't estates be rebuilt with increased density to house both existing social tenants and increase overall housing stock? </summary>

Many estates earmarked for demolition are already high density. They tend to be selected not on low density but rather on architectural fashions (grey, concrete, 'monolithic' etc).

In general, redeveloped estates do provide more homes but they tend to be smaller (1 & 2 bed, rather than the family size homes they are often replacing). See the Aylesbury estate for example.

## Making the case for refurbishment
 The [Engineering Exchange at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/) have produced a series of factsheets, videos and a peer-reviewed report, which show that refurbishment is the better option socially and environmentally.
